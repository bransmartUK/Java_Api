📌 Java API Project

🚀 Learning Java by Translating C# Work

Welcome to my Java API project! This repository is dedicated to translating work that I have previously done in C# into Java, using Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, and other relevant backend technologies.

📖 Purpose

I have extensive experience working with C#, but I want to strengthen my Java skills by taking existing C# projects and rewriting them in Java. This will allow me to:
	•	Reinforce my understanding of Java fundamentals.
	•	Gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot and backend development.
	•	Build a Java-based backend that mirrors the structure and functionality of my previous C# projects.

This project serves as both a learning exercise and a portfolio piece to showcase my transition into Java development.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Java 21
	•	Spring Boot (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA)
	•	Hibernate for ORM
	•	MySQL for database management
	•	Maven for dependency management
	•	Docker (future integration)

🚧 Current Progress
	•	✅ Set up Spring Boot project structure
	•	✅ Configured MySQL database with JPA and Hibernate
 	•	✅ Implemented CRUD Functionality for Users (Controller -> Service -> Repository)
	•	🔜 Adding authentication and security
	•	🔜 Building a full suite of RESTful API endpoints

📌 Future Plans

As I continue translating my C# work into Java, I plan to:
	•	Implement authentication (JWT or OAuth2).
	•	Optimize API performance using best practices.
	•	Explore microservices architecture and cloud deployment.
	•	Integrate logging and monitoring for better observability.

🤝 Contributions & Feedback

Since this is a learning-focused project, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and advice on improving my Java implementation. If you have experience in both C# and Java and notice areas for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR!
